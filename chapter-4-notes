== is a method
<< append to the end
nil? method on any value in ruby asking, "Are you empty?"

if, elsif, else all check for a POSITIVE CHARGE.
gets - kernel method like print 
  - pauses Ruby to let you type. When enter is pressed, it returns a string with what you typed

reverse - a string method
upcase - string method that capitalized characters in a string

HASHES
key-value pairs
each -    hurries through all of the pairs of the hash
gsub -    global substitution
        - used to search and replace 
        - first argument = word to find, second argument = word to replace the first word with
strip - a method that trims spaces and blank lines

Kernel - center of Ruby's universe 
File class - read, rename, and delete files

Dir::[] - searches a directory (folders)
p - prints anything 

blocks -  code that is grouped together if you used arrows inside an array, you'll end up with a Hash inside an array

ex: 
kitty_toys = [
  {:shape => 'sock', :fabric => 'cashmere'},
  {:shape => 'mouse', :fabric => 'calico'},
  {:shape => 'eggroll', :fabric => 'cashmere'},
]

sort_by  - iterator. iterates through a list of things
kitty_toys.sort_by {|toy| toy[:shape]} each do |toy|
  puts "Blixy has a #{toy[:shape]} made of #{toy[:fabric]}
end
